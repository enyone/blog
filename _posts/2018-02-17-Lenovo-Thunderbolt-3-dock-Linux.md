When surfing different web forums I found that Lenovo ThinkPad Thunderbolt 3 dock works well in Linux but that it is required to turn Thunderbolt security features off from bios. This is completely unacceptable, because Thunderbolt device can gain DMA access and thus dump the entire memory contents when attached to computer without you even noticing anything.

Do NOT turn off your Thunderbolt security features from bios ever.
