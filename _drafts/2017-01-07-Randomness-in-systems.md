Doing random things on purpose is very difficult. Especially with electronics. Things
may appear fully random but often are not in fact.

Still randomness is key part in important practices like cryptography. Thus it is
important to understand terms **random** and **randomness**.

end of TL;DR so now go and read...

Sources of randomness
---

There are three generally accepted sources of randomness:
* environment the system is working in
* initial conditions of the system
* things generated by the system itself

Randomness generated by the system itself is called **pseudo**randomness. There are no 

The power of random things is that those things are really unpredictable. In truly
random events no one is able to predict the nature of next event.

These events can be random in time, intensity, but often called as being stochastic.

Randomness in programming

Everyone should know this meme from xkcd:

```java
int getRandomNumber()
{
  return 4 // chosen by fair dice roll
           // guaranteed to be random
}
```

While its output being truly random above function is still quite unusable when
unpredictability is needed. And unpredictability is really needed.
