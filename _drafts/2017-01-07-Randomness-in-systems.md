Doing random things on purpose is very difficult. Especially with electronics. Things
may appear fully random but often are not in fact. Still randomness is key part in
important practices like cryptography. Thus it is important to understand terms
**random** and **randomness**.

end of TL;DR so now go and read...

Sources of randomness

There are three generally accepted sources of randomness:
* environment the system is working in
* initial conditions of the system
* things generated by the system itself

Randomness generated by the system itself is called **pseudo**randomness. There is no
mathematical source of true randomness.

The power of random things is that those things are really unpredictable. In truly
random events no one is able to predict the nature of next event. These events can be
random in time, intensity, but often called as being stochastic.

Randomness in programming

Everyone should know this meme from xkcd:

```java
int getRandomNumber()
{
  return 4 // chosen by fair dice roll
           // guaranteed to be random
}
```
> _http://xkcd.com/221/_

While its output being truly random above function is still quite unusable when
unpredictability is needed and unpredictability is really needed.

In computer system high enough unpredictability is often as useful as full
unpredictability. It is only a matter of energy (or value $$$) needed to predict
next event. As long as energy needed for predicting things is higher than the
value of the achievement of successful prediction we can say system is
unpredictable enough.

Instead of starting to create your own pseudorandom generator nearly all operating
systems provide the source of pseudorandomness.
