Doing random things on purpose is very difficult. Especially with electronics. Things
may appear asfully random but still are not.

Still randomness is key part in important practices like cryptography. Thus it is

There are three generally accepted sources of randomness:
* environment the system is working in
* initial conditions of the system
* things generated by the system itself

Randomness generated by the system itself is called **pseudo**randomness. There are no

While its output being truly random above function is still quite unusable when
unpredictability is needed. And unpredictability is really needed.
